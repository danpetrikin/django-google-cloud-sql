Toolkit for use django with Google Cloud SQL in AppEngine

This project is inspired (forked) in the very google djangoappengine project.

h2. INSTALATION:

Basicaly setup a basic django project,

pre. django-admin.py starproject example

and copy or synlink the djangoappengine_rdbms to the root of your project. 
You should not install or put these files in the path beacuse they need to deployed to
appengine. You can also checkout the example project


h2. SETUP: 

add the following line to your settings

pre. from djangoappengine_rdbms.settings_base import *

and configure you database. 

pre. DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'djangoappengine_rdbms.db.backend',
        'INSTANCE': 'djangosqlcloudmysql:example', 
        'NAME': 'example',                  # Or path to database file if using sqlite3.
        'USER': 'root',                         # Not used with sqlite3.
        'PASSWORD': 'root',
    }
}



h2. TODO:

# Make remote commands work - Google Cloud SQL does not use the stub services. Strategy: Access the directely the instance like the command line tool provided by Google
# Write better instalations intructions
